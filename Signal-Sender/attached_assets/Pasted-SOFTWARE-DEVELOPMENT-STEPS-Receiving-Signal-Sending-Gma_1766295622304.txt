SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT STEPS
(Receiving Signal → Sending Gmail Notification)
Phase 1: Planning & Setup
Step 1: Define Input Signal Format

Decide what data the hardware (ESP8266) will send.

Example:

{
  "door_status": "open",
  "alert": true,
  "duration": 5
}


✔ This will also be used for testing with fake signals.

Step 2: Choose Technology Stack

Finalize tools:

Backend: Flask (Python) or Node.js

Communication: HTTP POST

Notification: Gmail SMTP

Phase 2: Backend Development
Step 3: Create Backend Project

Create project folder

Initialize backend server

Run server on local host

✔ Confirm server runs without errors.

Step 4: Create Email Registration API

Endpoint: /register-email

Input: user Gmail

Store email (temporary variable or database)

✔ Test using browser or Postman.

Step 5: Create Alert Receiving API

Endpoint: /door-alert

Input: alert data from ESP8266 (or simulated signal)

Validate received data

✔ Print received data in console to confirm.

Phase 3: Email Notification Logic
Step 6: Configure Gmail SMTP

Create project Gmail account

Enable App Password

Configure SMTP settings in backend

✔ Send a test email manually from backend.

Step 7: Integrate Alert → Email Logic

When alert = true:

Trigger email function

Compose alert email message

✔ Email should reach phone via Gmail app.

Phase 4: Testing Without Hardware
Step 8: Simulate Hardware Signal

Use Postman / Python script

Send fake ESP8266 JSON to /door-alert

✔ Verify backend receives data and sends email.

Step 9: Error Handling & Validation

Handle missing data

Prevent duplicate emails

Add basic logging

✔ Makes system stable.

Phase 5: Final Preparation
Step 10: Integration Ready State

Keep API format fixed

Share API details with hardware team

No backend changes needed during integration

Step 11: Documentation & Demo

Prepare:

Software flow diagram

API explanation

Email notification screenshots

✔ Helps during evaluation.

Final Software Flow (One Line)
Signal Received → Validated → Processed → Email Sent

What You Can Say in Viva

“I developed the backend software that receives alert signals via HTTP and sends email notifications using Gmail SMTP. I tested the system by simulating hardware signals before actual integration.”
